My interest falls in the **Science**, **Engineering**, and **Business** perspectives of data science. 

### Science

* *A tricky pitfall of A/B Testing: Interference*, published on  [Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/interference-a-tricky-pitfall-of-a-b-testing-f940464cb5a0).

### Engineering

* A [demo](https://github.com/leolian003/Airflow-Redshift-ETL) of ETL pipeline, powered by airflow, that are highly reusable, easy to monitor, and allows backfills of historical data. 
  * [This](https://github.com/leolian003/Redshift-ETLandDW) is an important building block of the demo, an one-time ETL pipeline for a Redshift-based data warehouse.
* A [demo](https://github.com/leolian003/AWS-FraudDectectionPipeline) of data pipeline that enables real-time fraud detection on transaction data.

### Business

* My main contribution to the MIS Lab, A COVID-19 Hospitalization [dashboard](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/mili-misrc-covid19-tracking-project) (Substate-data tab) powered by Tableau. Shout out to my advisor Soumya Sen and my collegue Yi Zhu!
