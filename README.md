This repository contains the source code of my website, (Confidence in Interval)[leolian003.github.io], which is powered by Minimal Mistakes.

[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios. As the name implies, styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.
