Welcome! I am a data science practitioner with statistics background and professional experience in analytical consulting. My interest falls in the **stats and ML theories** as the pillars of data analytics, as well as **data science in practice**, including ML in production, reproducibility of analytics project, and data engineering. Currently, I am working as a geo data analyst at California.
