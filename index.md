Welcome! This website is used to showcase my work and thought on data science, product analytics, and data engineering. My interest mostly falls in the **technical pillars of data science**, particularly stats and ML concepts, as well as **data science in practice**, including ML in production, reproducibility of analytics project, and analytics for good. Currently, I am working as a geo data analyst at California.
