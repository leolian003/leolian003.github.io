Welcome to my personal website! This is a showcase of my thoughts and works on data science / data engineering. 

Currently, I am a Geo Data Specialist at LinkedIn, as well as a Volunteer Research Assistant at MIS Research Center, U of MN. **I am seeking full-time analytics and data engineering opportunities (relocation is ok)!** Feel free to contact me through email and Linkedin message!
