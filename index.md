Welcome! This is a showcase of my work and thought on data science, product analytics, and data engineering. My interest mostly falls in the **technical pillars of data science**, particularly stats and ML concepts, as well as **data science in practice**, including ML in production, reproducibility of analytics project, and analytics for good. Currently, I am working as a Geo data specialist at LinkedIn, as well as a Volunteer Research Assistant at MIS Lab, U of MN.

I am currently seeking full-time analytics and DE opportunity (ok with relocation)! Feel free to contact me through email and Linkedin DM!
