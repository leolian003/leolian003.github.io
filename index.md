Welcome to my personal website! This is a showcase of my thoughts and works on data science / data engineering. My interest mostly falls in the **theoretical pillars of data science**, particularly stats and ML concepts. In addition to that, I am also interested in **data science in practice**, including ML in production, reproducibility of analytics project, and analytics for good. 

Currently, I am working as a Geo Data Specialist at LinkedIn, as well as a Volunteer Research Assistant at MIS Research Center, U of MN. **I am seeking full-time analytics and DE opportunity (ok with relocation)!** Feel free to contact me through email and Linkedin DM!
